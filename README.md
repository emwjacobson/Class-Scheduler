## Background

I work at an after school program where students can take robotic classes. One problem we ran into is that we have classes with some new students mixed with students who have been coming for longer. It has been getting harder and harder to select which class to teach so that no student would take the same class, which is why I built this.

In this, you can add students and classes, as well as create a list of students and see which classes those students have not taken.
